<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Implement the flowchart below. Take a good look â€” there're two functions. The old blocks are in red. Be careful; some flows can now work differently.</p>

<h5>Objectives</h5>

<p>Implement the flowchart with two functions. Please, mind the recommendations below:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Don't use the built-in function <code class="java">eval()</code> to calculate from a string;</li>
	<li>Copy the messages carefully. The tests will check if the correct message appears in the correct order. Don't add extra lines or characters.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="java">msg_6 = " ... lazy"

msg_7 = " ... very lazy"

msg_8 = " ... very, very lazy"

msg_9 = "You are"</code></pre>

<h5>Example</h5>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter an equation
&gt; 2 / M
You are ... lazy
Yeah... division by zero. Smart move...
Enter an equation
&gt; 1 * M
You are ... lazy ... very lazy ... very, very lazy
0.0
Do you want to store the result? (y / n):
&gt; n
Do you want to continue calculations? (y / n):
&gt; y
Enter an equation
&gt; 899 * 0
You are ... very, very lazy
0.0
Do you want to store the result? (y / n):
&gt; n
Do you want to continue calculations? (y / n):
&gt; n</code></pre>
